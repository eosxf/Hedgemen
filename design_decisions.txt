Some design decisions for Hedgemen:

1: Hierarchies can only be 1 child deep (ie Parent -> Child, but not Parent -> Child -> ChildOfChild). Some systems may be exempt, such as UI.
2: Compatibility with ahead of time runtimes. Mods need not follow this rule, since ahead of time builds will not have modding support to begin with.
